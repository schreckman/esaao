esaao stands for (E) (S)ound (A)nalyser (A)udio (O)utputer

plan:

GUI program, in which you can give a twitch username as text and the program will connect to the streamers audio and
scans for words the user has to specify, when the streamer says one of the words the program will reply by starting
an audio which the user is hearing than.

usecases:

- a streamer using it themselves (playing horror game and being jumped scared whenever the streamer says "I'm scared")
- lurker/mod; whenever the streamer says your name


To-Do list:

Non-GUI:
- adding translations
- connecting to twitch streams
- routing the audio through an analyser
- detect "words"
- run audio if words are said
- changing language on runtime?
- making msgfmt run automatically

GUI:
- input field for streamer name
- adjust audio volume
- make GUI user-friendly SEXY :)
- menu area with options (audio volume?), (info about software), (language) etc.
